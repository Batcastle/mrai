mrai: Multiple Repository App Installer
---

mrai is an AUR-helper-like script for Debian-based Linux Operating Systems. mrai works with apt, snaps, flatpaks, and can install apps from GitHub.

# Dependencies
  `apt`
  
  `git`
  
  `checkinstall`
  
  `make`
  
# Recommends
  `snapd`
  
  `flatpak`
  
# Suggests
  `apt-fast`
  
  

As of yet, this is still pre-production software. There are definitly bugs that need to be worked out, as well as a Makefile that needs to be created to install, uninstall, and update mrai
