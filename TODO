TODO List for mrai:
In order of importance
  1. DEBUG DEBUG DEBUG
      Bugs to squash:
      1. When throwing a lone -i flag, mrai has a hard time dealing with the $2 var and what / how to install the indicated app
      2. Add the FlatHub remote if the user uses mrai to install flatpak, that way they can do stuff with it right away
      3. Add a print out so that if the user tries to do something with snapd or flatpak and it isn't installed they know
  2. Add a list installed feature
  3. Add a install from deb feature
  4. Add a check for updates feature
  5. Add a show app information feature (like `apt-get show`)
  6. Maybe add support for AppImages?
  7. Debug some more
  8. Getting in an existing apt repository or make one for mrai
